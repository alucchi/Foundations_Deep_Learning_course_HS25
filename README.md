## Continuous assessment

Note the following split:
- 15% continuous assessment (short exercises and Q&As given during exercise classes, Grading: Best 3/6 normalized)
- 25% mid-term exam (written). Preliminary date: during exercise session on Monday 03.11.2025
- 25% project (writeup and presentation (for bonus))
- 35% written exam (written)



## Exam
Date for written exam: Thursday, February 5, 2026, 10-12 a.m., Spiegelgasse 5, room 05.002.

Information about the exam: you can bring two two-sided A4 sheets or four one-sided A4 sheets (hand-written or latex).


## Projects
Projects have to be completed within a group of 2-3 students. Two types of projects you can pursue are:
1) A novel and sound solution to a problem discussed in the class
2) Thorough theoretical analysis of an existing deep learning approach discussed in the class
Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.
Deadline: Thursday, February 12, 2026, 12:00 Bern time
